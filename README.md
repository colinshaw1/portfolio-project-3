SINKING SHIPS
--
For my milestone project 3 for Code Institute Diploma in Software Development, I have chosen Project Example Idea 0. For this project I created a command line game called SinkingShips. The goal of the game is to guess all the letters in the word before your six lives run out. The game is pure chance butyou get the option for easy words with up to 5 letters or hard words with up to 8 letters choosen at random.
