SINKING SHIPS
--
For my milestone project 3 for Code Institute Diploma in Software Development, I have chosen Project Example Idea 0. For this project I created a command line game called SinkingShips. The goal of the game is to guess all the letters in the word before your six lives run out. The game is pure chance butyou get the option for easy words with up to 5 letters or hard words with up to 8 letters choosen at random. 

Who is this Game intended for?
--

The game is intended for anyone who has an intrest in computers and likes word puzzels. The game is used through the comamnd line so you will have to be familar with how a command line game works and running it before playing.

How to play

Sinking ships is a varaiation of the classic word puzzle game Hangman. In this version, the player has an option to enter 1 for an easy word which will be no more than 5 letters in length or choose 2 for hard whihc is 8 letters in length. The palyer has 6 lives to guess the word. Each time a letter is guessed the letetr appears on the display, the more you guess the easier it becomes to guess the word. The player must guess the word before the ship sinks. Once a game has ended the player has an option to select y for another game or n to end the current game. See below for pictures of how Sinking ships.
